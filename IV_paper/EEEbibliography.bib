abstract = {A new algorithm is developed to solve models with heterogeneous agents and aggregate uncertainty. Projection methods are the main building blocks of the algorithm and - in contrast to the most popular solution procedure - simulations only play a very minor role. The paper also develops a new simulation procedure that not only avoids cross-sectional sampling variation but is 10 (66) times faster than simulating an economy with 10,000 (100,000) agents. Because it avoids cross-sectional sampling variation, it can generate an accurate representation of the whole cross-sectional distribution. Finally, the paper outlines a set of accuracy tests. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We develop a method that uses second order approximations of Ramsey policies to obtain formulas for conditional and unconditional moments of government debt and taxes that include means and variances of the invariant distribution as well as speeds of mean reversion. Asymptotically the planner's portfolio minimizes a measure of fiscal risk. Analytic expressions that approximate moments of the invariant distribution apply to data on a primary government deficit, aggregate consumption, and returns on traded securities. For U.S. data, we find that the optimal target debt level is negative but close to zero, that the invariant distribution of debt is very dispersed, and that mean reversion is slow.},

The "curse of dimensionality" is avoided due to four complementary techniques: (1) exploiting symmetry in the approximate law of motion and the value function; (2) constructing a concentration of measure to calculate high-dimensional expectations using a single Monte Carlo draw from the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks; (3) sampling methods to ensure the model fits along manifolds of interest; and (4) selecting the most generalizable over- parameterized deep learning approximation without calculating the stationary distribution or applying a transversality condition. As an application, we solve a global solution of a multi-firm version of the classic Lucas and Prescott (1971) model of "investment under uncertainty." First, we compare the solution against a linear-quadratic Gaussian version for validation and benchmarking. Next, we solve nonlinear versions with aggregate shocks. Finally, we describe how our approach applies to a large class of models in economics.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for the computation of dynamic stochastic equilibrium models. We design an FPGA specialized in the computation of a Bellman equation via value function iteration (VFI). Our hardware approach exhibits significant speed gains vis-{\`{a}}-vis GPU-based data-parallelization techniques. The speed gains arise from two layers of parallelism, accessible to hardware developers: instruction-level and pipeline parallelism at the logical resources level. By and large, the paper documents significant computational speed gains from hardware specialization, so far unexplored by the macroeconomic literature.},

Iterative modulo scheduling is an algorithm for software pipelining in the presence of resource constraints. Integrating the best features of both yields a pipelining algorithm, retimed modulo scheduling, that can more effectively exploit the idiosyncrasies of reconfigurable hardware. It also fits naturally into a design space exploration process to trade-off speed for power, energy or area.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/SIGDA Tenth International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays}, pages = {177–186}, numpages = {10}}
